* These commands are automatically created with the tool SpatialAggregation.py (see auxils folder)        



* DO NOT insert new commands in between the "PYTHON SPATIAL AGREGGATION START/STOP" strings,        



* and do not modify these strings in any way as they are used as locaters for the script.        



* It is bad practice as commands could be overwritten by a future, different aggregation.
