# Spatial Aggregation

[This branch](https://github.com/balmorelcommunity/Balmorel/tree/mberos-spatialaggregation) is used for analysing the effect of various spatial resolutions in Denmark. The pre-processing of raw data is performed using the [following balmorel-preprocessing tool](https://github.com/Mathias157/balmorel-preprocessing/tree/spatial_study), and the prepared .inc-files for the fully resolved model can be found in the [data repository](https://github.com/balmorelcommunity/Balmorel_data/tree/mberos-spatialaggregation).
